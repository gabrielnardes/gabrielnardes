# So, we finally meet again, my friend... :man_with_turban:

- ✏️ I'm a aspiring **Java** developer, immersing myself into **Spring**, **SQL** and **REST API**.
- 💡  Here is my main side project nowadays, a Java [Production Planning & Control application](https://github.com/gabrielnardes/pcp).
- 🤖 In college I developed **motion control algorithms** for multiple stepper motors for a [**Delta Robot**](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=QFZMhsVn_CE), and worked with [**OpenCV**](opencv.org) library for object detection and camera calibration (**C/C++**).
