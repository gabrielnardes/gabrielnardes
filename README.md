# So, we finally meet again, my friend... :man_with_turban:

- ✏️ I’m currently immersing myself into backend: Javascript, Typescript, REST API, Node.js, PostgreSQL and MongoDB.
- 🤖 I developed motion control algorithms for multiple stepper motors for a Delta Robot, and worked with OpenCV for object detection and camera calibration (C/C++).
- 🖥️ My other interests are computer graphics, programming languages and computer architecture.
- 🧭 Bucketlist: 8-bit computer with TTL transistors; SNES emulator.
- 🙂 I like beer :beer:, Star Trek :milky_way:, Guimarães Rosa :books:, and putting emojis everywhere :grimacing:. 
- 👋 Let's code a project for fun, for a job, or the sake of coding itself :dancers:
- 💥 [This link magically sends you to my Linkedin profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gabriel-nardes-giampietro/).
