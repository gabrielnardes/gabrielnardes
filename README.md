# So, we finally meet again, my friend... :man_with_turban:

- ✏️ I’m currently immersing myself into backend: HTML, CSS, Javascript, Node.js, PostgreSQL and MongoDB.
- 💜 C/C++ are my childhood friends, and I'm never going to leave them behind.
- 🖥️ Flirting with OpenGL and computer graphics.
- 🤖 I developed motion control algorithms for multiple stepper motors for a Delta Robot, and worked with OpenCV for object detection and camera calibration.
- 🧭 Bucketlist: 8-bit computer with TTL transistors - SNES emulator.
- 🙂 I like beer :beer:, Star Trek :milky_way:, Guimarães Rosa :books:, and putting emojis everywhere :grimacing:. 
- 👋 Let's code a project for fun? For a job? For the sake of coding itself?! Don't call me maybe, call me sure! :dancers:
- 💥 [This link magically sends you to my Linkedin profile](https://www.linkedin.com/in/gabriel-nardes-giampietro/).
